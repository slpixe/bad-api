# Bad Api 
## Embrace the Chaos of Real-World API Interactions

Bad API is intentionally unreliable. 
It ~~randomly~~ systematically times out, throws errors, 
responds unpredictably, or even refuses to respond at all. 
Designed to mimic the messy, imperfect nature of real-world APIs, 
Bad API challenges developers to build robust, 
resilient applications that can handle anything thrown their way. 
Whether you’re learning to code, testing error handling, or stress-testing 
your system, Bad API is here to help you prepare for the 
unexpected—because in the wild, APIs rarely behave perfectly.
